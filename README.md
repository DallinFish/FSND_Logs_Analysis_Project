# FSND_Logs_Analysis_Project


This is a reporting program for the Full-Stack-Nanodegree Course. It answers The following three Questions in the format seen below in the examples. You will need to have your environment setup per the course instructions.

### Questions from the course

  1. What are the most popular three articles of all time? Which articles have been accessed the most? Present this information as a sorted list with the most popular article at the top.

  Example:

    * "Princess Shellfish Marries Prince Handsome" — 1201 views
    * "Baltimore Ravens Defeat Rhode Island Shoggoths" — 915 views
    * "Political Scandal Ends In Political Scandal" — 553 views

  2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time? That is, when you sum up all of the articles each author has written, which authors get the most page views? Present this as a sorted list with the most popular author at the top.

  Example:

    * Ursula La Multa — 2304 views
    * Rudolf von Treppenwitz — 1985 views
    * Markoff Chaney — 1723 views
    * Anonymous Contributor — 1023 views

  3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors? The log table includes a column status that indicates the HTTP status code that the news site sent to the user's browser. (Refer to this lesson for more information about the idea of HTTP status codes.)

  Example:

    * July 29, 2016 — 2.5% errors

## Quickstart

Assuming you have pulled down the files from the repo and are in the environment per the course, run the following command from the terminal:

'''python

This will display the results to the three questions.
